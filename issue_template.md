# Please make sure that the issue you are reporting is
# actually related to the .run packaging. This reposetory
# is afteral only just a repackaging of monodevelop and 
# nothing more.

# PS. If the MonoDevelop is not starting when launched
# from the launcher or terminal, you can look at the
# log file located at ~/.config/MonoDevelop/7.0/Logs/Ide.log
# to get the crash error and figure out what you are missing.
